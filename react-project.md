# REACT
## Introduction

### Welcome

- Using React 1+ year
- Not an expert! 
- Complicated to learn, easy to get good at, complicated to get great at 
- Informational purposes only

### What is React?

- A JS library for creating Single Page Applications (SPAs)
  - SPAs send one request to the server on page load, and the content is rendered client side with each request
  - Browser sends a single request and later interactions involve async API calls using AJAX or Fetch API
  - SPAs allow for a better user experience and faster page loads

### Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Growing in popularity
- Performant 
- Easily integrate reusable components to your app (navbar, footer, sidebars, etc.)
- Lots of libraries and third-party tools
  - Redux for managing state 
  - React Router for navigation
  - NextJS for full-stack functionality 
- Better SEO

Cons:
- Strictly a frontend framework 
- Learning curve 
- Complex state (variable) management in larger projects 
- Some updates can be quite radical (NextJS 13->14)

### Getting Started

Run following command (using npx):
`npx create-react-app my-app`
